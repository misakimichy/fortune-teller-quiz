## Description
Build a Fortune Teller Quiz Webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery)

### Website should have:
Create a fortune teller quiz that contains several question forms that use checkboxes to select answers. Each question should instruct users to "Check all that apply".

**A Stress Test**

- include a series of questions that instruct users to "Check all that apply".

- Then, based on how many answers the users selected in each of several 'categories', provide them customized results.

- For instance, you could prompt users to select each of the stereotypically "unlucky" events that have occurred to them in the last month ("Seeing a black cat", "Walking under a ladder", "Stubbing your toe", etc.), then how many "lucky" events have occurred ("Finding a four-leaf clover", "Seeing a rainbow", etc.) Then, based on this, provide them a silly fortune.

- Include at least 3 possible results.
